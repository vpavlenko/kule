# Styling Rules for Kule Project

## Backgrounds
- Default background is #000000 (black).
- A toggle allows switching the background to #ffffff (white).
- Background is only defined at the main application container level (e.g., body or top-level div); nested components must not redefine their background color and should inherit or be transparent.
  Apply to: All UI components.
